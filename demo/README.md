# WebOpenCV Demo

View the source code at [`webopencv` on Github](https://github.com/alvinwan/webopencv/tree/main/demo).

Note that launching a Glitch demo from this folder runs `app.py` by default. For all the demos in this
folder, we've set `framerate=5` to accommodate the weaker CPUs that Glitch provides. (relative to your
own computer's CPU)

See the following assortment of files for different demos:

- `simple.py`: Minimal WebOpenCV example with a single transformation.
- `custom.py`: Custom homepage with minimal HTML needed for WebOpenCV to work
- `app.py`: A more fleshed out WebOpenCV demo with all the default transformations. A few bells and whistles.
